**About Me!**  
Hey, I'm Sophie! I've lived on each side of this wonderful country that we call Australia, but currently call Sydney home. I graduated from high school in 2016 and have been enjoying my time since binge watching Netflix and trying nearly every snack that my local servo has to offer! 

**Interest in IT**  
I Suppose that my interst in IT was influenced from an early age, with my father working in the Royal Australian Navy and then in the mining industry in Western Australia. I was always interested in how things work and what new technologies were being brought out to help with whatever he was doing. After he left the mining industry, I was lucky enough that he let me see some of what he was doing, by this time it was in robotics and I loved it.  
At the moment I have little to no IT experience (*apart from the small amount of high school coding that I did*), but I am excited to see everything to know and learn.

I chose to come to RMIT University because I knew that with the endless possibilities that the future can have, I wanted to be with a University that could help me understand it the best.

What I expect to learn from my studies is a better understanding of IT and a more indepth knowledge of what is out there both at the moment and in the future.

**Ideal Job**
